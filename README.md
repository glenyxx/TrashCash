TrashCash: Waste-to-Wealth Marketplace

In major Cameroonian cities like Yaoundé and Douala, waste management has become a daily crisis. Overflowing bins, trash littering the streets, and blocked drainage systems have become the norm. With waste disposal companies like HYSACAM stretched beyond capacity, garbage often sits uncollected for weeks. This doesn't just create an eyesore it leads to serious health risks, environmental pollution, and missed economic opportunities from materials that could be recycled or repurposed.

TrashCash is a mobile app designed to tackle this problem head-on by turning everyday waste into real value. It introduces a smarter, community-driven way to manage waste by rewarding citizens, empowering waste collectors, and bridging gaps in the recycling economy.

Key Features:

- Reward System for Recycling
  Users scan QR codes on recyclable materials like plastic, cans, and e-waste to earn points. These points can be redeemed for useful rewards like mobile airtime, groceries, or even cash — motivating people to recycle rather than dump.

- Waste Picker Professionalization
Informal collectors are connected with verified buyers such as recycling companies and scrap dealers. This ensures they receive fair prices, while helping formalize a sector that’s often overlooked yet essential.

- Scheduled Collection Service
  Households and businesses can book reliable pickups from vetted waste collectors, reducing dependency on overwhelmed public waste services and preventing trash buildup.

- Community Waste Mapping  
  Citizens can report illegal dumping sites via the app. Volunteers are incentivized to organize cleanups in exchange for rewards, promoting civic responsibility and environmental awareness.

- E-Waste Drop Points
  An interactive map shows users the nearest safe locations to dispose of old electronics, batteries, and other hazardous waste, preventing toxic materials from ending up in landfills or water systems.

Expected Impact:

- Cleaner neighborhoods and reduced urban flooding due to better waste flow  
- Income and job creation for youth and informal waste workers  
- Improved public health and environmental safety  
- Less pressure on city waste services  
- A more circular, sustainable economy built around recycling and reuse
